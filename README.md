# Hangman (user guesses computer's word)


This script will play a game of hangman with the user.  For this rendition of the game the user guesses letters for the word that is predetermined by the computer.
The computer picks a word randomly from a list that it must open called "words_stripped.txt".


I originally started with a list of words called "words.txt".  This list included symbols, numbers, long strings of 1 character, and was not case sensitive.
Less_words.py is another script I created to fix all thse problems with "words.txt"
